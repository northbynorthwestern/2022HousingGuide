              <td id="campus">Generally, South Campus is known for humanities and North Campus is known for STEM, mostly because of proximity to classes. North Campus also has more of a party reputation for its proximity to fraternity quad, but South Campus has more of an artsy vibe and is a shorter walk to downtown Evanston, grocery stores and restaurants. If you want to live in a suite, look to the several dorms on North Campus, but beware the walk South to downtown and classes in the winter. We divided the dorms into North and South Campus based on Foster St.

        in it (Plex is the other). If you lose your keys, you won't have to go far because 
        the South Area Desk is located in Allison. Rooms are known for being spacious and carpeted. It's
         in close proximity to the study spaces in Shepard, the 1838 gym and the sorority quad. No one
          actually calls it Hotel Allison, but some people say it's called that.
        <br><br>
        Allison offers all-gender housing on the first floor that students 
        must opt into. Students can select either singles or doubles. The community bathrooms are labeled all-gender on that floor.

        "The room is big, it's a great location and it's so convenient to live on top of a dining hall."<br>
        - Class of 2025
        <br><br>
        "I have met most people at Allison outside of Allison. Lots of people come to hang out in the first floor lounge. Allison is definitely less social than other dorms. I would maybe prefer to live North Campus like in Elder just so I could get to classes at Tech faster."
        <br>- Class of 2025
        <br><br>
        "The vibe in Allison is very chill. I like how it's clean and new. The dining hall is also very accessible. The only thing I dislike about Allison is that there's not enough lighting and ventilation."
        <br>- Class of 2024
        <br><br>
        "The dorm isn't too old so it's still pretty clean. I didn't have a choice to live anywhere else. Allison is pretty good. I like how it's super close to the dining hall so you can always get food in your pajamas. However, I wish there could be better lighting."
        <br>- Class of 2024
        <br><br>
        "It's super quiet. You don't really get to know the people in Allison. But the dorms are super nice, and the bathrooms are cool, and the dining hall is downstairs, so the amenities make up for the lack of social life. Also love having laundry on the same floor. But the dorm is quiet and probably isn't the place to make a lot of friends. I'm not sure if I would change because the dorm is really nice, but I would like to live somewhere more social."
        <br>- Class of 2024
        <br><br>
        "I like how it's right on top of a dining hall and close to all my classes on South Campus. Even if my classes are at Bienen or Swift Hall, they are still very walkable from Allison. I wish my room could be bigger and closer to the laundry room and the elevator."

        "I would say that Ayers is very friendly and calm. I like that we have very spacious rooms, which is something that is rare for North Campus. It is also nice that we have basic amenities like an elevator and air conditioning. One complaint I have is that laundry can be very frustrating, and the walls are a bit thin, but that's no problem if you invest in some good earplugs for sleepy time. I would not want to live anywhere else. I will admit that I have fallen in love with Ayers despite its minor flaws."

        Plex used to be limited to second-year students and up, but now it's open to freshmen. 
        Because of that, Plex's formerly isolated reputation has shifted. One of its perks is a dining 
        hall on the ground floor divided into Plex West (which stays open until 10 pm) and Plex East (known

        "The vibe depends on which floor you're on. Some floors are very outgoing, and they get to know each other a lot, and they'll be loud at night, but in a good way. Some floors are very keep to yourself, quiet, everybody does their own thing. There's something about the roommate experience that you miss out on, for sure, but I think there are a lot of other aspects that make up for it, especially the fact that the whole building is singles. You get to know people, nobody's like hiding in their room, away from everyone else. You have the food and the convenience store and the laundry, which is very convenient. My least favorite part about living here would be that the walls are very thin. It's in the perfect spot on campus, because it's South Campus, which is by most of the classes, but it's the northernmost part of South Campus, so it's still not far from any of the north buildings. If you have a hard time making friends, though, I might not recommend it."

The walls are super thin, which isn't great, and the bathrooms aren't super nice, but they do the job."

        "It's very chill, it's very friendly. I would say most of the friends I have come from Plex. It's the Plex ecosystem. I think there's a stigma because of Plex being kind of an isolation dorm because of Covid and because it's all singles, but I actually found it very easy to make friends because no one had that instant roommate connection, so everyone was always out in the hallways."

        "Honestly, I was a bit hesitant when I first moved in because it's just a dorm full of singles, and everyone called it the prison dorm or the quarantine dorms, but after moving in I realized that my floor has a cute little community. My least favorite thing is how thin the walls are, because I'm kind of loud, and I feel bad especially because of my loud friends. I love that the dining hall and package center are right downstairs. It's kind of in the middle of campus, so it's not too far from either end, and it's closer to downtown when I have to do things there. My favorite thing is having a single dorm that's pretty cute. We have brick walls and windows that don't have bars on them, which is pretty cool."

We have a kitchen, library, lounge area and basement filled with other rooms like our computer lab and exercise area. I don't dislike anything about the dorm, really. I would live in Hobart again, but the only reason I'm moving out is so I can have a single room next year. Hobart has singles, but they were all chosen before I was able to select one."

        "The vibe is cottagecore or cozy and close-knit, friendly. It's an older building, and you can tell, but it also offers a lot of charm in the architecture and stuff! The laundry is in the basement, and laundry maintenance is not great, and the carpeting should be replaced, but there are so many spaces to be social and have guests. There's a general con of community living in terms of kitchens and bathrooms, but it's only slightly better in suite-style living. A smaller dorm is less daunting because it's not like total strangers in the bathroom. If I were to select dorms again maybe I would want something closer to my classes, but even then I would be a non-res at Hobart because the community is so nice and welcoming."

Pretty good location since you're next to downtown Evanston and Allison dining hall. Most of the people are super nice and welcoming. It is much more social than I had thought, which was a plus.

        "Building-wise, Shepard is beautiful: everything is fairly clean and new, and it's hard to feel disappointed by its ambience. It's a bit worse community-wise, though, since the residents generally stick to themselves / their friend groups and bonding events are basically nonexistent. It's hard to reach out and become close with other Shepard residents - especially later in the school year. The only candidate I would rank above Shepard would be Willard, as it shares both benefits of a nice ambience + a closer community."

        "Neat and clean, modern, chill but maybe a little antisocial across floors. The facilities are great, and the entire dorm looks modern and renovated! I think having nice bathrooms really makes a difference for the whole "living on campus" experience. The rooms aren't huge, but it's more than enough space (it looks much smaller on the website than it does in person). If I had to nitpick, having microwaves on each floor would be really nice, as would an elevator when you're lugging suitcases up to the fourth floor."

I like the location of Shepard and the bathrooms for sure. The basement is also super nice to have because there are a lot of nice facilities and study spaces down there. I don't like that it's a little antisocial and there isn't an elevator there, but honestly you get used to having to go up the stairs - coming from someone who lived on the fourth floor. It's definitely a great place to live - especially if South Campus is your vibe."

        quad. It has the exact same layout as North Mid-Quads (NMQ). It houses Shepard Residential 
        College, not to be confused with Shepard Hall (if someone says Shepard they're probably referring 
        to Shepard Hall, not SMQ). The dorm hosts events often and has a reputation for being social. It 
        also has a ping pong table, foosball table and a kitchen. Its residents are proud to be called 
        Sheep. SMQ has an intramural sports rivalry with Willard.
        <br><br>
        Accessibility note: SMQ has a handful of dorm rooms on the ground floor but no elevator. On the 
        other floors there are only dorm rooms. Laundry and common spaces are all located on the ground floor.

        "Such a fun and engaging community! A diverse group of people and always so much going on. You can be as involved or uninvolved as you want, but even aside from events there are always people playing video games or studying downstairs, and everyone is so friendly! I like that so many people in the dorm make an effort to get to know others, and everyone is friendly and kind.
        I dislike that there are only three sets of washers and dryers for 75 people. I got randomly assigned to SMQ, but I'm so glad I did."
        <br> - Class of 2024
        <br><br>
        "SMQ is very social, community-based, supportive and fun. It's the kind of dorm where you can ask your neighbors for sugar and play Just Dance in the lounge. It's the best dorm on campus in my opinion. Super great location for people who want to live on South Campus. The sorority quad is beautiful. Being a res college, the weekly events are so fun and great for getting to know people. The only thing I dislike is the laundry machines because they don't work half the time. I did incredibly thorough research on dorms before doing the housing selection. SMQ seemed like the best option, and it absolutely still is."
        <br>- Class of 2025

        "It's welcoming, quirky, close-knit and energetic. The community is really great - everyone is very friendly, and it's easy to meet people. There are multiple social events per week, which are very fun and bring people together. Logistically, it's easy for sophomores to get single rooms, provided they have enough points from events, and the bathrooms are nice too. I wouldn't want to live anywhere else! I only have good things to say about SMQ."

        "I like the community atmosphere that comes in a res college and that everyone is really friendly. While I would say SMQ is very chill, it is not antisocial at all. Res colleges are definitely the move. Don't be worried about choosing a South Campus dorm if you're a STEM student. Tech to South Campus is not that far, and it's nice to get to meet a lot of new people who may not be in your classes."

        "I feel like the vibe is kind of like, we're working with what we have. And we've built up, at least on our floor, a pretty good community, despite the struggles. It's a great location. The exec board does a great job. There's lots of activities that you can engage in to help you get more involved, and you'll probably enjoy your experience here a little more."

        "I feel like there's just two different vibes - there's energetic, 'Let's have fun, let's have conversation, let's talk all day type - and then there's just the side that's like 'Let me just relax in my room and enjoy some solitude.' So you have both, and you get to choose which one you want. Going to do the laundry if you live on the third floor is six flights of stairs. This building is old, it's a little bit run-down, it should be demolished, but it still exists, so taking that into consideration I think I would pass. It's the people who are great. The building itself? No."

        "I think that West Fairchild is very friendly. There are four communal lounges on each floor, which is super amazing because any time during the week or on the weekends people will just be there studying or hanging out, and it's so easy to walk by and join in on a conversation. Everyones super nice and super fun to hang out with. I think that the executive board and the residential college really fosters friendship among residents, and you also get to do a lot of cool stuff as a residential college member outside of the dorm as well. There are a lot of fun trips you can go on that you're only privy to if you're a residential college member."

Overall, I would say come here if you don't care about your living conditions and would like the convenience of classes and the tight-knit community of a res college."

It is also possible that you can get stuck in a smaller double, and it does feel cramped at times, especially with the one small window."

          Allison, so we've got our choice of dining hall), and it's really not a far walk from Tech, where 
          the majority of my classes have been. However, THIS DORM WAS NOT READY TO BE LIVED IN! The so-called

          the radiators from HELL that thunk extremely loudly at all hours of the night and the front door to

         I really like the common spaces in the dorm. The atmosphere is pretty homey, and it's nice to have a
          living room with a TV. Major downsides to this dorm are that it doesn't have AC and things are frequently

        It's one of the cheapest dorms to live in, which is nice. The rooms are decently large. And our washers/dryers 
        are brand new! However - the dorm is renovated in the most general sense. They stuck in some ugly modern furniture and

        your own bathroom with your suitemates. There are kitchens located throughout the building.

        Lincoln offers all-gender housing. There is not a designated all-gender housing wing, and

        have people over, as the suite style rooms enable hosting. Being at the north 
        end of campus can sometimes get tiring, especially during a quarter where all 
        of your classes are south. I really enjoy having an elevator, my own bathroom and a 
        kitchen on every floor. It's a super bright and clean dorm, which makes it feel homier."

        the bathroom area is so clean and nice and private! The nice kitchens and lounges 
        on each floor are also great for studying or watching a movie with friends! The on
        e thing about Lincoln is that the suite style is not conducive for making friends. 
        It's hard to meet people and befriend people on your floor. Lots of people I know in
         other dorms made most of their friends at first from where they lived, but that isn't 
         the case in Lincoln. Amenities > everything, you'll make your friends elsewhere anyway."

        and it's the northernmost dorm (so kinda far from stuff)."

        `"It's chill, pretty quiet. The downstairs area could be used to hangout or for smaller parties, so that's cool. Everyone kinda keeps to themselves but is friendly when interacting. We have a good basement area, pool tables, fourth floor lounge is huge. The rooms are quiet and spacious, and they stay pretty cool most of the year. Laundry always breaks, and there are only two washers/dryers for the whole building. Cockroaches, house centipedes and spiders aren't a rare sight. No elevator (along with kitchen and laundry in basement) means a lot of going up and down flights of stairs. This place is nice, but I would've preferred living on the second floor so the stairs aren't an issue."
